# Lessons Learned — Agent Working Notes

A running list of mistakes the agent has made on this project and corrective
rules to prevent them from happening again. Every entry references the
session date so future agents can reconstruct context.

## 2026-06-24 — Confirm-or-Omit Directive (permanent, project-wide)

**User directive, recorded verbatim:**

> *"on sentiment pulse summaries NEVER invent context, only confirm context explicitly. IF you can't confirm do not create an issue positive or negative from the posts we are accumulating. Commit this to lessons.md and the project requirements overall."*

**Status:** Promoted to CLAUDE.md §20 (Confirm-or-Omit) — a CRITICAL always-on requirement on the same tier as §13/§14/§15/§19. Every claim in every summary, recommended action, and big idea must be confirmable against a specific post in the source data fed into that LLM call. If a claim cannot be pointed to a specific post, the claim does not get made. No issue, positive or negative, is surfaced from posts that do not specifically and unambiguously confirm it. Saying nothing is preferred over saying something invented.

This is not a heuristic. It applies to every prompt currently in the project and every prompt added in the future. Mechanically enforced by `_anti_fabrication_clause()` in `backend/services/period_summary_service.py`, which is invoked from `_call_exec`, `_call_actions`, and `_call_bold_ideas`. Regression test: `backend/tests/test_anti_fabrication.py` asserts the clause is in each prompt — not just that current outputs happen to be clean.

The full operational rule lives in CLAUDE.md §20. This entry exists in lessons.md so the directive's exact wording and date are preserved in the agent's working notes alongside the failure that prompted it (see the Hellraiser/Jamie Clayton entry below).

## 2026-06-24 — LLM fabricated a celebrity name in the digest (anti-fabrication rule)

**What happened.** The live weekly digest for Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival surfaced "Jamie Clayton voice casting" as a Recommended Action and proposed partnering with Jamie Clayton in a Big Idea. The user caught it: Doug Bradley is the cast Pinhead voice actor in the game, not Clayton (Clayton played Pinhead in the 2022 Hulu film).

Ground truth from `raw_posts` for game_id=21 in the 7d window:

  - posts mentioning "Clayton": **0**
  - posts mentioning "Bradley": **1** ("Doug Bradley returns to voice Pinhead in Hellraiser Revival")
  - posts mentioning "Pinhead": 2 (both confirming Bradley)

The LLM autocompleted Clayton from background knowledge of the franchise's film history. The community didn't mention her. The model invented a celebrity name and used it as if it came from the data.

**Why this happened.** Three prompt functions feed Claude: `_call_exec`, `_call_actions`, `_call_bold_ideas`. The exec-summary prompt already had an explicit anti-fabrication clause ("Do NOT invent specifics that aren't in the samples or entities list") — and the resulting executive summary correctly stayed generic ("Minor friction surfaces around voice casting preferences"). But the actions + bold-ideas prompts had no such constraint. They told the LLM to "reference a SPECIFIC entity" but did not restrict the source of that entity to the input data. The model treated franchise background knowledge as fair game.

This is also a CLAUDE.md §19-shaped failure: an intermediate signal (the prompt asked for "specific entities") was treated as sufficient to guarantee fidelity, but the actual ground truth (the post corpus we fed in) was not enforced as the only valid source.

**Rule (permanent, no exceptions):**

Every prompt that asks Claude to surface named entities (people, characters, DLC, patches, modes, levels, weapons, voice actors, etc.) MUST include a clause that:

1. Limits valid entities to those appearing **verbatim** in the input data (sample posts or distinctive-entities list).
2. Explicitly forbids using **background knowledge** about the franchise, its prior games, its movies, its actors, or its lore.
3. Provides a fallback: if no proper-noun entity is in the data, fall back to a topic label or respond NONE.

This is implemented as a shared helper `_anti_fabrication_clause()` in `period_summary_service.py` and is now invoked from all three `_call_*` prompts. Regression test: `backend/tests/test_anti_fabrication.py` asserts (a) the clause is present in each prompt when data is supplied, (b) the prompt's data section contains only real entities from the input (no Clayton), and (c) the empty-data fallback "NO SPECIFICS AVAILABLE — do not invent" form is used when both samples and entities are empty.

**How to apply this rule going forward.** Whenever a new prompt function is added that synthesizes from community data into an analyst-facing output, the FIRST thing to add — before specificity preferences, before formatting rules, before the data section — is the anti-fabrication clause. The order is: identity → output style → anti-fabrication → task → data → format.

## 2026-06-24 — Verify domain ownership before suggesting DNS work (§19 violation)

**What happened.** During the Resend email-sender setup, the agent suggested using `mail.sentimentpulse.com` as the verified sending domain for the digest. Reasoning was: "the domain name matches the product name, so the user must own it." The agent then registered `mail.sentimentpulse.com` in the user's Resend account and prepared DKIM / SPF / MX records, all before checking whether the user actually owned `sentimentpulse.com`.

The user pushed back: "i thought we didn't reserve a domain like sentimentpulse.com for this site and are just relying on the IP address." Ground-truth check (`curl https://sentimentpulse.com/`, `dig +short A sentimentpulse.com`) revealed:

- The domain resolves to `15.197.225.128` / `3.33.251.168` (AWS Global Accelerator) — NOT the SentimentPulse droplet IP `104.236.239.46`.
- The domain serves an unrelated commercial product called "Sentiment Pulse | AI-Powered Stock Analysis."
- The user's actual SentimentPulse app lives only at `http://104.236.239.46/sentiment/` — a droplet IP path, no domain attached.

The agent had been about to walk the user through a 20-minute Cloudflare nameserver-switch + 3 DNS-record exercise on a domain they don't own.

**Why this happened.** The agent treated a *name match* as ownership evidence. It also conflated memory notes from `lifetime-class-booker` (which has its own domain setup) with SentimentPulse. The agent's mental model assumed every product has a matching domain, which is not how this user works — SentimentPulse is currently a droplet-IP-only deployment.

**Rule (permanent, no exceptions):**

Before suggesting ANY DNS work, domain configuration, registrar changes, or claiming a domain on behalf of the user, the agent MUST:

1. **Run `dig +short A <domain>` and `curl <domain>`** to see where the domain points and what it serves.
2. **Confirm with the user explicitly** that they own/control the domain. A name match ("sentimentpulse.com matches SentimentPulse") is NOT evidence of ownership.
3. **Check the actual production URL** the user uses to access the app, not the domain the agent assumed.

This is a specific instance of CLAUDE.md §19: ground truth must be verified before action, never assumed from naming coincidences. "Domain X exists with a related name" is an intermediate signal; "the user owns and controls Domain X" is the ground truth that authorizes DNS work.

The cost of guessing wrong here was bounded only because the user caught it. If the user had said "sure, sounds good" the agent would have walked them through a 20-min DNS-on-a-domain-they-don't-own exercise that would have failed at the very first step.

**What to do for transactional email when the user has no domain:**

- Either ask the user to pick + register a domain, OR
- Restrict the recipient list to only the Resend account owner's verified address (the no-domain-needed path), OR
- Use a domain the user has already verified ownership of (confirmed by an actual question and an actual whois / DNS check, not by name resemblance).

Written 2026-06-24 after the agent registered `mail.sentimentpulse.com` in Resend and had to delete it via `DELETE /domains/{id}` to clean up the mistake.

## 2026-05-30 — Never declare success on intermediate signals; verify ground truth

**Mistake (two confirmed instances, one detected by the user):**

1. **2026-05-29 Bluesky rollout.** Claimed "2,167 posts saved across 26/28 games" based on the dashboard endpoint and `bluesky_metric posts=100 status=ok` log lines. Did not run a direct DB count of rows where `collected_at >= run_started_at`. Reality happened to be correct, but the verification was unsafe — the same proxy would have missed an analogous Reddit failure.

2. **2026-05-30 Reddit cron diagnosis.** Earlier today's cron pulled 0 Reddit posts. While investigating, claimed "Reddit is working perfectly right now" after a manual ingest, citing `arctic_shift_metric ... status=ok posts=25-49` lines in the live ring buffer. The user pushed back and asked me to actually verify the claim. A direct DB count showed **zero** Reddit rows saved across all 28 active games today — despite Arctic Shift returning 25-49 posts per subreddit. The buffer's `status=ok` was a fetch-side signal; persistence was the actual question, and persistence was 0.

The second case is the harmful one. If the user had not pushed back, I would have built retry/notification infrastructure on top of a still-broken save path. The retry would never "recover" anything because the bug was never about fetch volume — it was about persistence dropping every post silently.

**Rule (now permanent, formalized as CLAUDE.md §19):**

Before declaring success on anything that produces persistent state, identify the **ground truth** of the claim and run the direct query/check that measures it. Specifically:

- **Ingest success** = `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM raw_posts WHERE source=? AND collected_at >= run_started_at`. Not log lines. Not status field. Not buffer counters.
- **Bug fix success** = the original failing user action now produces the expected outcome. Not "tests pass". Not "function returned non-empty".
- **Deploy success** = a fresh request to the live endpoint returns the new behavior. Not the green CI checkmark.

When the bug being fixed was "X ran but didn't persist", the post-fix verification MUST measure persistence — not that the buggy step now reports success. The signals that lied during the bug cannot be the proof of the fix.

Differentiate "fetched" from "saved" in every observability statement: those are two different facts and they are not interchangeable.

When the user reports the symptom is still present after a claimed fix, STOP and re-verify ground truth before proposing any new fix. Don't assume "transient". Don't change scope. The user observed reality.

See `CLAUDE.md` §19 for the full canonical rule.

## 2026-05-29 — Never ask the user to run a command without including the command

**Mistake (twice in one session, in the same debugging thread):**

While diagnosing the Reddit fetcher 403 errors, the agent asked the user to run a
PowerShell line and paste the output back — but did NOT include the actual command
in the message. The user had to ask for it before they could proceed.

**Rule (permanent, no exceptions):**

When the agent asks the user to run any command — in PowerShell, bash, cmd, a SSH
session, a browser console, anywhere — the agent MUST include the exact
copy-paste-ready command in the same message as a fenced code block.

Specifically:

- ✅ "Run this in PowerShell and paste the output:" followed by a `powershell`
  code block with the literal command.
- ❌ "Run this single line and paste back what you see." (no command provided)
- ❌ "Open PowerShell and run a curl test." (vague, not paste-and-run)

This is true regardless of which UI tool the agent is using (ask_user_question
with free_text_only, plain prose, confirm_action, etc.). If the prompt text
contains "run this" or "execute this" or any equivalent phrasing, a code block
with the command MUST be included beside it. Re-read the message before sending
to confirm the command is there.

This rule reinforces the broader user preference (already in memory) that all
commands given to the user must be complete, paste-and-run executable verbatim,
with no edits, no placeholders, and no copy-this-paste-that steps.
